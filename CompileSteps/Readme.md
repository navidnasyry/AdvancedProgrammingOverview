Got it! Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the **C++ compilation process** without example code, focusing on what happens at each stage:

---

### **1. Pre-processing**
#### What Happens:
- The **preprocessor** processes the source code before compilation.
- It handles directives like:
  - `#include`: Inserts the contents of header files.
  - `#define`: Expands macros.
  - `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#endif`: Handles conditional compilation.
- Removes comments from the source code.
- Expands all macros and includes.

#### Output:
- A **preprocessed source file** (e.g., `hello.ii`) is generated, which contains the expanded source code.

#### Command:
```bash
g++ -E hello.cpp -o hello.ii
```

---

### **2. Compilation**
#### What Happens:
- The **compiler** takes the preprocessed source code and translates it into **assembly code**.
- Performs syntax and semantic checks to ensure the code is valid.
- Generates assembly code specific to the target processor architecture.

#### Output:
- An **assembly file** (e.g., `hello.s`) is generated, containing low-level instructions for the processor.

#### Command:
```bash
g++ -S hello.ii -o hello.s
```

---

### **3. Assembly**
#### What Happens:
- The **assembler** converts the assembly code into **machine code** (binary instructions).
- Translates human-readable assembly instructions into binary object code that the processor can execute.

#### Output:
- An **object file** (e.g., `hello.o`) is generated, containing machine code.

#### Command:
```bash
g++ -c hello.s -o hello.o
```

---

### **4. Linking**
#### What Happens:
- The **linker** combines one or more object files and libraries into a single **executable file**.
- Resolves references to external functions and variables.
- Links standard libraries (e.g., C++ Standard Library) and other dependencies.

#### Output:
- A final **executable file** (e.g., `hello`) is generated, which can be run on the target system.

#### Command:
```bash
g++ hello.o -o hello
```

---

### **5. Execution**
#### What Happens:
- The **executable file** is loaded into memory and executed by the operating system.
- The program runs, performing the tasks defined in the source code.

#### Command:
```bash
./hello
```

---

### **Summary of Steps**
1. **Pre-processing**: Expands headers, macros, and removes comments.
   ```bash
   g++ -E hello.cpp -o hello.ii
   ```

2. **Compilation**: Translates preprocessed code into assembly code.
   ```bash
   g++ -S hello.ii -o hello.s
   ```

3. **Assembly**: Converts assembly code into machine code (object file).
   ```bash
   g++ -c hello.s -o hello.o
   ```

4. **Linking**: Combines object files and libraries into an executable.
   ```bash
   g++ hello.o -o hello
   ```

5. **Execution**: Runs the final executable.
   ```bash
   ./hello
   ```

---

### **Combined Command**
If you want to skip the intermediate steps and compile directly, you can use:
```bash
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
```
This single command performs all the steps (preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking) and produces the executable.
